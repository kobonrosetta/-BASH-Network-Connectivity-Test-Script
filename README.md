Bash script that can be used for anything on your network, that can be reached by its Internet Protocol address. 
Script will ping each address twice to ensure connection and move on to the next address. 
Script will continue to run till you close it.

I made this script so I can ensure that multiple Apple TV's were functioning properly. This can be used for anything to ensure that it is connected to your network and is powered on.
